                    Company's founding and growth into a total consumer electronics provider (1979-1969)

                <p class="para">
                    Shortly after its founding in 1969, Samsung Electronics quickly became one of South Korea’s leading manufacturers. Its early growth was attributed to the fact that the domestic consumer electronics industry was just starting to take off, and the company began exporting its products. During this time, Samsung also acquired Korea Semiconductor, the first wafer processing company to be established in Korea, paving the way for Samsung to become a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.

                    In the 1980s, Samsung established a new corporate identity focused on securing its own technology, strengthening its R&D, expanding its semiconductor business into the advanced VLSI field, and operating a telecommunications business through Korea Telecommunication Company. It also launched its first global production subsidiary in Portugal and increased its overseas sales subsidiaries to establish itself as a global company.

                <p class="para">
                    In the aftermath of a global financial crisis, Samsung Electronics leaned into its culture of creativity and autonomy and an organizational structure that saw each business division managed independently to thrive during a tumultuous period.
